# NodeJS Module Start-up
This is a simple empty NodeJS module that can be used as template.
It's already configured to work with TypeScript.

## How to use it
There's no magic to it so using `npm install`, `npm link` and those thing is
totally possible.

Once your code is ready you can run this command to build/_transpile_ your code:
>npm run build

And if you want to to keep coding while it automatically builds your code, you
can this command:
>npm run build:live

Or just:
>npm start

## Cleaning
If you've been creating and deleting code files and you think your `lib`
directory may have some garbage, just run this command and it will clean that
directory and rebuild:
>npm run clean-up

## Tips
Here you have a few docs that can help you start and solve some issues:
* [Unknown Types](docs/unknown-types.md)
* [Using `npm link`](docs/npm-link.md)
